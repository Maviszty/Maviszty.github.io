<title>Tianyi (Mavis) Zhang</title>
Hi, I'm Mavis. Currently, I'm working as a researcher at iFlytek AI Lab. And I'm seeking a Ph.D. position specializing in NLP and machine learning. 
Previously, I earned a B.S. in Statistics at Rutgers University and an M.S. in Data Science at Fordham University. I like AI in general, and I'm now developing an AI audiobook narration system.
I would love to play Taekwondo and sketch during my leisure time. I hope to stay true and humble throughout my life. If you think I'm a good fit for your lab, please get in touch with me!
